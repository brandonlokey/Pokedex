# Pokedex

Created a simple Pokemon searching website inspired by the Pokedex in the game with HTML and JavaScript Users can search a Pokemon in the search bar and then get information on the pokemon's stats and their attacks. In progress currently, working on implementing Pokemon list page, dedicated homepage, and more.
